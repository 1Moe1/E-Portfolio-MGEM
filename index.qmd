Hey there,

This is an attempt to create my portfolio using Quarto. yaaay!

So, I am currently doing my msc (geomatics for environmental management) at the University of British Columbia. As of now, this msc exposed my to lots of things in geomatics, really interesting things that I am using to build on my skills.
